# Tips for model_3
## the test of model yolo_v3
- Directory structure:
    - darknet:
     - backup: a directory to save trained model
     - cfg: diffrent network model protext
     - data: some example images 
     - results: seems like the backup  directory, you can choose one of them to save the trained model
     - scrips: a directory to prapare data and process 
    - README.md
- explain:
    - darknet: the official directory of yolo v3, github: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
    - install: you should install the yolo v3 api (gpu or cpu) depend on your computer
    - pre_train: you will have to download the pre-trained weight file,such as yolov3.weights(test) and darknet53.conv.74(train)
- procedure:
    - according to blogs, change `Markfile`, `./scripts/voc_label.py`, `./examples/detecor.c`
    - install darknet 
    - peapare datases, refrence to https://blog.csdn.net/cgt19910923/article/details/79725875
    - `prepare_data.sh` to mkdir data direction and cp img and xml to crresponding files 
    - `change_voc` to set  `cfg/voc.data` ,`data/voc.names`,`cfg/yolov3.cfg` according to your dataset 
    - `run_train.sh`: choose the suitable commond according your computer version(gpu or cpu) 
    - after trained well, you can test your test_image by `run_test_list.txt` or `run_test_single.sh`
